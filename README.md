### üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

*I am a highly skilled and results-driven Full Stack Java Developer with over 8 years of experience in developing and maintaining web-based client-server applications, microservices, and enterprise software solutions. With a deep expertise in Java, Python, and modern front-end technologies like React, Angular, and JavaScript, I have a proven track record of delivering robust, scalable solutions using frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate, and J2EE. My experience spans the full software development lifecycle (SDLC) in both Agile and traditional environments, where I‚Äôve collaborated on designing, developing, testing, and deploying high-performance applications.*

*I have worked extensively with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as containerization tools like Docker and Kubernetes. In addition to my technical abilities, I excel in continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices, having implemented pipelines using Jenkins and Git. With a strong background in both back-end and front-end development, I am passionate about leveraging innovative technologies to build seamless, user-friendly applications that drive business success.*

### Work Experience

- **Client: BestBuy, Minnesota -- sep-2024 - present**
- **Role- Full Stack Java Developer:**
I assisted in the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including design, development, testing, and integration of web-based and client/server applications using Java/J2EE technologies. I worked extensively with Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Spring Boot to develop RESTful and SOAP-based microservices, deploying them on Docker and AWS EC2. Leveraging Agile methodology, I implemented new features, wrote complex SQL queries, and utilized Hibernate for data access and manipulation. I also contributed to frontend development using Angular 7, React.js, and other technologies like Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, I was involved in DevOps activities, configuring Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Delivery (CI/CD), automating jobs with UNIX shell scripts, and managing Docker containers for efficient environment provisioning. My work with Apache Kafka enabled reliable, asynchronous data exchange across business applications, and I also migrated legacy AngularJS components to Angular 7 to improve responsiveness and reduce dependencies.

- **Client: Fannie Mae, Washington DC -- March 2023 ‚Äì Aug 2024**
- **Role- Java/J2EE Developer:**
I contributed to the development and testing of the Streamlets module, including analysis, design, development, and both system and user acceptance testing. I migrated the application from Ant to Maven to improve build and deployment support on Tomcat and developed multithreading solutions using Core Java and Executor Service for enhanced performance. I transitioned the logging framework from Log4j to Logback and followed Agile methodology, managing user stories via JIRA. Additionally, I built a full MEAN stack, created secure RESTful services with Spring Security OAuth 2.0, and addressed server security using tools like BigFix and Carbon Black in the cloud.


- **Client: Magellan Financial, Topeka, KS -- Nov 2021 ‚Äì Feb 2023**
- **Role: Java Full Stack Developer:**
I developed dynamic web pages using JSPs, Servlets, and JavaScript, and built workflow-based applications with Spring MVC, Hibernate, and AJAX, deployed on Apache Tomcat. I integrated Struts with Spring, designed SOAP and RESTful web services, and configured Hibernate for CRUD operations. I enhanced the UI with AngularJS, jQuery, and JavaScript and built a microservices library using Spring Boot and AWS. Additionally, I designed the internal login page with Bootstrap 4, created Java Beans, and documented the Mazda Customer Engage Portal's functional and technical aspects. I used JIRA for tracking tasks and bugs throughout the process.

- **Client: Ziply fiber, Washington DC -- May 2020- Oct 2021**      
- **Role: Software Developer:** 
I designed and developed REST-based microservices using Spring Boot, JSP, HTML, AJAX, and jQuery, delivering APIs in an agile environment. I applied design patterns like Singleton and Factory for maintainable code and developed modules with Spring Batch, Apache Camel, and Hibernate. I created unit tests with JUnit, logged with SLF4j+Log4j, and optimized Oracle queries for performance. Additionally, I integrated AngularJS with backend APIs, worked with IBM MQ for messaging, and automated transaction reports with Groovy scripts.

- **Client: Sutherland Global Technology, India -- Aug 2017 - Dec 2019**       
- **Role: Software Developer:**
I worked in an Agile environment, contributing to design, development, and testing. I built responsive web interfaces using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React JS, and Bootstrap, and developed Spring MVC controllers with Spring AOP for security and transaction management. I focused on Single Page Applications (SPAs) with React JS, using Redux and Flux architecture, and implemented RESTful web services with Hibernate. I deployed the application on Apache Tomcat, managed builds with Maven, and used JIRA, Jenkins, and Selenium for CI/CD and automated testing.
